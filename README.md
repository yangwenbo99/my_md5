An easy-to-read and short MD5 implementation in C++ written during studying a Cyber-security course.

This is by no means to be a replacement to md5sum, as it is around one third slower than it.  However, this may be a good education tool for students to understand block based cryptological hash value calculation. 

The calculation of MD5 is modeled as state transition of a state machine.
